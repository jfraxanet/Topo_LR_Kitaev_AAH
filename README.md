# Toplogical properties of the long-range Kitaev chain in the presence of a Aubry-André-Harper modulation

> While the physics and topological properties of the 1D short-range and long-range Kitaev chains in
spatially homogeneous chemical potential are well understood, it is not the case for inhomogeneous
potentials. In this paper we present a detailed study of the bulk topology at the central gap and
edge states of the long-range Kitaev chain with Aubry-André-Harper potential. In the long-range
case, the topological massive Dirac modes at the edge require a critical amount of superconductivity.
The critical values of superconductivity, however, depend on the long-range decay exponent α, and
as such these values are very different for the short and long-range scenario. Interestingly, in the
long-range case the massive Dirac modes in the presence of Aubry-André-Harper potential can
recombine to form Majorana modes. We observe the clear lack of bulk-boundary correspondence in
such scenario: the bulk topological invariant does not exhibit any change in its behavior, while there
appears a dramatic change in the edge physics. Finally, we observe that the topological behavior
away from the central gap of the system is governed by the Aubry-André-Harper potential, and it
is characterised through a 2D Chern invariant. We see that the Aubry-André-Harper edge modes
are dramatically affected by the long-range superconducting pairing, so that they start exhibiting
weak bulk-boundary correspondence.
